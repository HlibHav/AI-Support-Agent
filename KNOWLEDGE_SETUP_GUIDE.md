## üîç Testing Your Knowledge Base

### Using the Chat Interface

1. **Navigate to Enhanced Chat**: Select "Enhanced Chat" in the application
2. **Test Sample Questions**:
   ```
   How do I get started with TaskFlow Pro?
   What are the different pricing plans?
   How do I create a new project?
   What should I do if I can't login?
   How do I integrate with Slack?
   ```

### Using the Knowledge API

```bash
# Search the knowledge base
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/search" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "query": "How do I create a project?",
       "limit": 5,
       "similarity_threshold": 0.7
     }'
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Knowledge Base Issues

### Common Problems and Solutions

#### Knowledge Base Not Building
```bash
# Check for file permissions
ls -la Knowledge/

# Verify file formats
file Knowledge/*.docx

# Check build logs
python build_knowledge_base_robust.py --verbose
```

#### Search Returns No Results
- Verify knowledge base was built successfully
- Check that documents contain relevant content
- Try different search terms
- Rebuild the knowledge base

#### Poor Search Quality
- Use vector-based build for better semantic search
- Ensure documents have clear structure
- Add more diverse content
- Adjust similarity thresholds

#### Memory Issues During Build
- Use text-based build instead of vector-based
- Reduce document size or number
- Increase system memory
- Use lightweight build option
