# ü§ñ AI Support Agent - First-Line Support Automation

> **AI Product Manager Portfolio Project**  
> *Automating first-line support using AI to reduce response times and improve customer satisfaction*

---

### **Situation**
As an AI Product Manager, I identified a critical business challenge: **manual first-line support was creating bottlenecks** in customer service operations. Support teams were overwhelmed with repetitive inquiries, leading to:
- **Long response times** (24-48 hours average)
- **High operational costs** ($50-75 per ticket)
- **Customer dissatisfaction** due to delayed resolutions
- **Agent burnout** from handling repetitive queries
- **Inconsistent response quality** across different agents

### **Task**
**Primary Objective**: Design and implement an AI-powered support automation system that could:
- **Automate 70% of first-line support inquiries**
- **Reduce response time from 24 hours to under 5 minutes**
- **Maintain or improve customer satisfaction scores**
- **Integrate seamlessly with existing support workflows**
- **Provide real-time analytics and monitoring**

**Key Requirements**:
- Handle natural language customer inquiries
- Integrate with existing ticket management systems (Redmine)

### Phoenix Observability

- **Global instrumentation**: Phoenix automatically launches when the application starts and instruments all LangChain-based agents
- **Modern OpenInference**: Uses the latest OpenInference instrumentation instead of legacy Phoenix trace modules
- **All agents monitored**: SimpleTicketAgent, EnhancedTicketAgent, and TicketAnalysisAgent are all automatically instrumented
- **Status indicator**: The sidebar shows Phoenix availability status and any initialization errors
- **Access the Phoenix UI**: Available at `http://localhost:6006` when running
- **Automatic setup**: No manual configuration needed - Phoenix starts globally and instruments all agents

**Phoenix Status Indicators:**
- ‚úÖ **Phoenix observability active**: Phoenix is running and all agents are instrumented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Phoenix observability unavailable**: Phoenix failed to initialize (see reason below)

**Requirements:**
- `arize-phoenix>=3.0.0`
- `openinference-instrumentation-langchain>=0.1.43`

If Phoenix fails to initialize, the application will continue to work normally but without observability features.

## üí° Usage Examples

### Example Queries for the Chat Agent

1. **General Analytics**:
   - "Give me a summary of all support tickets"
   - "What are the current trends in our support tickets?"
   - "How many tickets do we have by priority?"

2. **Specific Searches**:
   - "Show me all payment-related issues"
   - "Find tickets assigned to Anna Tinna"
   - "What urgent tickets are still open?"

3. **Pattern Analysis**:

   - Loads and cleans CSV data
   - Performs pattern analysis and clustering
   - Provides search and filtering capabilities

2. **Ticket Agent** (`src/ticket_agent.py`):
   - LangGraph-based intelligent agent
   - Multiple analysis tools
   - Phoenix integration for observability

3. **Streamlit App** (`streamlit_app.py`):
   - Web interface
   - Interactive dashboard
   - Chat interface

### Technology Stack

- **LangGraph**: Agent orchestration and workflow management
- **Phoenix**: LLM observability and monitoring ([Arize Phoenix](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix))
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash**: Fast and capable language model for analysis
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualizations
- **Pandas**: Data processing and analysis
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning for clustering

## üîç Data Format

Your CSV file should contain the following columns (adjust column names in the code if needed):

- `#`: Ticket ID
- `Subject`: Brief description
- `Description`: Detailed description
- `Status`: Current status (New, Open, Closed, etc.)
- `Priority`: Priority level (Low, Normal, High, Urgent, Immediate)
- `Assignee`: Person assigned to the ticket
- `Author`: Person who created the ticket
- `Created`: Creation date
- `Updated`: Last update date
- `Project`: Project or category
- `Last notes`: Recent updates or comments

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding New Analysis Tools

To add new analysis capabilities:

1. Add a new tool method to the `TicketAnalysisAgent` class
2. Decorate it with `@tool`
3. Add it to the `self.tools` list
4. The agent will automatically discover and use the new tool

### Modifying Visualizations

Charts and visualizations are created using Plotly. Modify the chart creation functions in `streamlit_app.py` to customize:

- Chart types
- Color schemes  
- Layout and styling
- Data aggregations

### Custom Data Sources

To use different data sources:

1. Modify the `TicketDataProcessor` class to handle your data format
2. Update column mappings in the processing methods
3. Adjust the CSV loading logic as needed

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No module named 'phoenix'"**:
   - Install Phoenix: `pip install arize-phoenix`
   - Phoenix is optional; the app will work without it

2. **Gemini API Errors**:
   - Verify your API key is correct
   - Check your Google Cloud account has Gemini API enabled
   - Ensure you have sufficient quota for API calls

3. **CSV Loading Errors**:
   - Check that your CSV file exists and is readable
   - Verify column names match expected format
   - Ensure proper encoding (UTF-8 recommended)

4. **Performance Issues**:
   - Large datasets may take time to process
   - Consider filtering data or using smaller samples for testing
   - Phoenix UI may use additional memory

## üöÄ Next Steps

Consider these enhancements:


## Knowledge Base Setup

### Memory Requirements
Building the knowledge base requires significant memory due to:
- Loading SentenceTransformer model (~500MB)
- Creating FAISS embeddings

### Building Options

#### Option 1: Manual Build (Recommended)
1. Start the Streamlit app
2. Go to the "Knowledge Base" tab
3. Click "Build Knowledge Base"
4. Monitor progress and handle any memory issues

#### Option 2: Standalone Script
```bash
python build_knowledge_base.py
```

#### Option 3: Pre-built Indices
If you have pre-built indices, place them in the project root:
- `knowledge_vector_index.faiss`
- `knowledge_documents.pkl`

### Troubleshooting Memory Issues

If the build process gets killed:

1. **Close other applications** to free memory
2. **Use Activity Monitor** to check memory usage
3. **Restart the app** and try again
4. **Consider building offline** using the standalone script

### Memory-Efficient Strategies

1. **Batch processing**: Documents are processed in small batches
2. **Lazy loading**: Knowledge base only loads when needed
3. **Index persistence**: Once built, indices load instantly
4. **Garbage collection**: Memory is freed after each batch

## üöÄ Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify everything is working:

### 1. Service Health Checks
```bash
# Check all services are running
docker-compose ps

# Check service health
curl http://localhost:8502  # Streamlit app
curl http://localhost:8000/health  # Knowledge API
curl http://localhost:6006  # Phoenix (may take a moment)
```

### 2. Application Features
- ‚úÖ **Dashboard**: Access metrics and visualizations
- ‚úÖ **Chat Agent**: Test with sample queries
- ‚úÖ **Redmine Integration**: Connect to your Redmine instance
- ‚úÖ **Knowledge Base**: Build and search documentation
- ‚úÖ **Phoenix Observability**: Monitor agent performance

### 3. Troubleshooting
```bash
# View logs for issues
docker-compose logs -f ai-support-agent
docker-compose logs -f knowledge-api

# Restart services if needed
docker-compose restart

# Check resource usage
docker stats
```
